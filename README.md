# Snake.py123456789
This is a simple snake game created in Python.
I recommend running it in Pycharm EDU.


# Pycharm EDU Setup
Make sure to have python 3.8.3 installed to your computer before setup. Once you have python installed either run it in the IDLE application that comes with it or install Pycharm. To install Pycharm first go to this link: https://www.jetbrains.com/products.html#lang=python Once that is done open this up in it. Then run it.
