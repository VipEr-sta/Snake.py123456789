## Supported Versions
This is secure and is a fun game to play. It can be played on Windows for the exe and the 123456789 version. It can be played on Mac on the 123456789 version. Right now the game is 600 by 600 so it is smallscreen. I'm working on a widescreen version that will be realeased but the current version I am calling 1.1.
Current versions: 1.1
