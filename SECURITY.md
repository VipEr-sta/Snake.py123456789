# Security Policy

## Supported Versions
This is secure and is a fun game to play. It can be played on Windows for the exe and the 123456789 version. It can be played on Mac on the 123456789 version. Right now the game is 600 by 600 so it is smallscreen. I'm working on a widescreen version, but it has a bug where the food may spawn off screen which is being worked on. 
Current versions: 1.1 = 123456789 and exe, 1.2 = V 1.2
